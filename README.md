## How To Use
There are 2 ways to use these files:
* Method 1 - .SAV file - The CNC.SAV file is a sav file meant for user with an e-reader rom or by loading it into the SRAM storage of an actual ereader.
* Method 2 - .bmp files (3) - These 3 files can be printed (hard to do) and scanned using the ereader.

## How to Compile
I'm too lazy to type this right now, but a Makefile is included if you have the right toolchain setup. More on that when I get around to udpating this again... Or you can go watch Episode 1 of the stream where I cover my toolchain (see above).
